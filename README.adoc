OSRAM
link:https://www.osram.com/osram_com/tools-and-services/tools/lightify---smart-connected-light/[Lightify] is a smart home, connected lightning technology. Lights, switches and other paired devices are controlled using the Lightify gateway device. This gateway is an always-on, always-connected device which can be controlled using the official Lightify REST API on the Lightify Cloud. That, however, means that all commands need to be routed through the internet.

The official Lightify app, on the other hand, communicates directly with the gateway and uses a proprietary binary protocol which is not publicly specified.

This document is meant to create a public specification of the known facts about how to discover gateway devices, paired devices and zones/groups, as well as how to control those devices.

== Basics about the Protocol

The OSRAM Lightify gateway protocol is a binary protocol with a specified header.

The underlying protocol is a persistent TCP connection which does not seem to support multiplexing, therefore multiple requests should be sent one after another. To support multithreading, multiple connections should be used.

The TCP protocol works over port _4000_ and discovery can be implemented using mDNS (multicast DNS, aka Bonjour). Further information in <<Lightify Gateway Discovery>>.

Multibyte values encoded using little-endian encoding and considered unsigned values.

String values are encoded using UTF-8 encoding and of fixed length. Unused bytes are filled with _0x00_.

=== Headers

The protocol defines seems to define a common header for both requests and responses. The header consists of the packet's length, a packet type, the command id and a still unknown value (most probably reserved for later use).

Furthermore the header contains a request id which is recommended, but not required, to be monotonly increasing (and wrapping around to startover when surpassing _65535_). The response will feature the same request id and can be used to assign responses to requests.

.Packet Header
|===
| Byte(s) | Description | Possible values

| 0-1
| Length of the packet, incl header length
| WORD: _0x00_ >= x <= _0xFFFF_

| 2
| Packet type (flag)
| BYTE: enum -> +
_0x00_: Light Device +
_0x01_: Device response? +
_0x02_: Broadcast +
_0x03_: Zone Response?

| 3
| Command Id
| BYTE: See <<Lightify Commands>>

| 4-5
| Unique, increasing request id
| WORD: _0x00_ >= x <= _0xFFFF_

| 6-7
| Unknown
| WORD: ???

| 8
| Error code?
| BYTE: enum -> +
_0x00_: No error? +
_0x01_: Wrong parameter? +
_0x14_: ? +
_0x15_: Command cannot address a zone? +
_0x16_: ? +
_0xA7_: ? +
_0x0B_: ? +
_0xC2_: ? +
_0xD1_: ? +
_0xFF_: Unknown command?

|===

If the packet is not a broadcast (addressing type != _0x02_), the device or zone address header is following up right after the header. In case of a broadcast, the header is followed by the commands data. Addressing of specific zones or devices is defined in the following section.

=== Error Response

In case of an illegally addressed packet or any other type of error, an error response packet is returned from the gateway. The packet consists of the header only and the last byte seems to define an error code. See previous table for a list of known? error codes.

== Device Types

The OSRAM Lightify gateway uses the Zigbee Light Link communication protocol, however it is also able to communicate with certain other device types of the Lightify series, such as switches, motion sensors and power plugs / sockets.

A device type is sent with status updates to identify the type of the device as well as the capabilities of a specific device.

.Device Type
|===
| Id | Description

| 10
| Lightify bulb

| 16
| Plug / Power socket

| 32
| Motion Sensor

| 64
| Switch

| 65
| Switch

|===

== Device and Zone Addressing

Each paired device has a unique address (MAC). Multiple paired devices can be controlled at once by adding them to zones / groups, which are addressed using the zone's id.

An address always contains 8 byte, no matter it's adressing a device or zone and is directly followed by the command's specific data.

.Addressing Header
|===
| Byte(s) | Description | Possible values

| 8-15
| Address
| QWORD: See the following specification

| 16-...
| Command specific data
| See <<Lightify Commands>>

|===

=== Device address

Devices are addressed by, what seems to be, a hardware address, similar to MAC addresses used in networking devices.

.Device Addressing
|===
| Byte(s) | Description | Possible values

| 0-7
| Device address
| QWORD

|===

While discovering devices the device's address is made known to the application, controlling the gateway, and the paired device can be addressed directly (whereas the command packet is still routed through the gateway).

*Attention:* Device addresses are transmitted as 8 bytes, not as strings!

=== Zone address

Zones are identified by their zone id. Addressing itself, however, is still using 8 bytes, even if zone ids seem to be limited to _0xFFFF_. That said, the addressing is built as following:

.Zone Addressing
|===
| Byte | values

| 1
| BYTE: lower significant byte

| 2
| BYTE: higher significant byte

| 3-7
| BYTE[6]: _0x00_

|===

== Lightify Commands

Lightify commands are either used for broadcasts, like device or zone discovery, or contain information to control a specfic device or zone.

The following table is most probably incomplete and more commands are available. Response packets often follow a very similar scheme, therefore it should be easy to find new packets and analyze their content.

Known command ids are put into the following list:

.Commands
|===

|===

As visible from the list, a lot of command ids seem either unused or, what is more presumable, unknown at the current point in time.

== Command data

Most commands carry additional information starting after the header (for broadcast packets) or after the addressing header (non-broadcast packets).

The following sections define the packet's structure after either of both headers, according to the command type.
